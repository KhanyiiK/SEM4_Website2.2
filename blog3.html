              <p><b>Dimara, E. and Perin, C. (2020) ‘What is Interaction for Data Visualization?’</b><br>
                <p>The close reading titled ‘What is Interaction for Data Visualization?’ thoroughly examines
                     the concept of interaction in data visualization. The authors take an approach by combining 
                     insights from practitioners with quantitative metrics resulting in a comprehensive analysis. 
                     One key focus is distinguishing between data visualization and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
                     which reveals differences that shape the challenges and goals of data visualization. The reading 
                     provides a definition of interaction for data visualization highlighting the importance of human 
                     intent, causality, and technology neutrality. It also offers strategies for incorporating flexibility 
                     into visualization tools empowering designers to create user friendly interfaces. By addressing 
                     research opportunities and challenges the reading emphasizes the need to not enhance interaction 
                     diversity but also consider user profiles, modalities, and associated costs. Overall, it 
                     serves as a guiding resource for the data visualization community providing a roadmap for 
                     research while enhancing clarity and user centricity, amidst the vast amount of available data.</p>
    
                <p>The term " data visualization" is used to describe the utilization of software, for data analysis, 
                    which allows individuals to directly manipulate and explore graphical representations of data. 
                    Data visualisation uses tools to help analysts quickly grasp the significance of the data. By 
                    incorporating tools that let users change the settings of visualisations, interactive data 
                    visualisation software improves this idea by encouraging insights that inspire new research 
                    and extract the full value from the data. As stated in the reading, "interactive data visualisation 
                    software improves this idea by encouraging insights," (Dimara and Penn, 2020) which is consistent 
                    with the main premise of the authors' work. The introduction acknowledges the increasing need, 
                    for interaction in data visualization and how it plays a role in enhancing understanding. 
                    It highlights the challenges of defining interaction within the context of Human Computer 
                    Interaction (HCI) emphasizing its complexity. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is an 
                    interdisciplinary branch of research devoted to studying how computers are designed and, 
                    more specifically, how people (the users) and computers interact with one another. The 
                    next section explores debates in the field underscoring the lack of consensus on what 
                    interaction means and its role. This aligns with the authors goal of bringing these perspectives 
                    and providing a comprehensive definition. In the following section they describe their approach 
                    to reviewing papers on interaction giving priority to expert input and bridging the gap between 
                    their insights and wider understanding. Their meticulous process for collecting and categorizing 
                    papers as explained in this section forms a foundation for their analysis of interaction, in visualization.</p>
                
                <p>The comprehensive examination of our interaction, with information entails an exploration of the existing research. 
                    Then attempting to encompass every aspect it focuses on the contributions in this field. To gain an understanding, 
                    it combines expert insights with an approach to identify and analyse the most notable papers. To comprehend how 
                    individuals engage with data they posed questions, to seasoned researchers in this domain. They also compiled an 
                    organized list of papers starting with a select few and progressively incorporating more based on expert recommendations. 
                    This ensured coverage of a range of topics pertaining to our interaction with visuals. The papers were categorized 
                    according to their ideas enabling them to identify patterns and trends. To ensure a range of perspectives they 
                    engaged in discussions, with 77 experts who possess knowledge about visual data. 
                    </p>
                    
                <p>Additionally, they sought insights from 22 individuals who had contributions to make. By selecting research 
                    papers and incorporating these various inputs they gained a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies 
                    of interaction within the realm of visuals. Throughout this study several significant themes emerged that 
                    shed light on the complexity of interacting with visuals, "The study helps us see how we use pictures and 
                    charts better. It looks at important research and talks to experts. They say many things about how we work 
                    with visual data. It is a tremendous help in understanding this topic."(Dimara and Penn, 2020) Researchers 
                    shared their perspectives on the meaning of interaction and its impact on the process of working with data. 
                    From preparing and organizing the data to presenting the outcomes interaction plays a role. They also explored 
                    approaches to interacting with visuals highlighting both their strengths and limitations. This review provides 
                    insights into how we have currently engaged with visual information while inspiring ideas, for future advancements.

                <p>In the "Flexible Data Interfaces" section the authors highlight the significance of having actionable definitions 
                    as well as discussing the practical aspects of interaction in visualization. They introduce a classification system, 
                    for types of actions within data interfaces dividing them into data actions, perceptualizing data actions and non-data 
                    actions. This classification provides a framework for understanding interactivity. Additionally they define flexibility 
                    in a data interface as the range of actions that users can perform and the various means of interaction available for 
                    each action, "Good interaction maximizes directness, simplicity and 'naturalness' of the dialogue, while also providing 
                    'a strong sense of understanding and control.'"( Dimara and Penn, 2020) This definition offers an approach to describing 
                    and comparing data interfaces. The contribution of this section aligns with the objective of the paper, establishing a 
                    comprehension of interaction in visualization through a practical evaluation method and enriching our understanding of 
                    flexibility, with real world insights. The parts discussing research possibilities and challenges, limitations and 
                    conclusions provide insights, into the field of data visualization. In the section about research opportunities the 
                    authors highlight the importance of not increasing the number of interactions allowed but also ensuring their quality. 
                    They emphasize factors like user friendliness catering to diverse user profiles and utilizing approaches. They draw a 
                    parallel between this challenge and Tuftes concept of data ink ratio emphasizing the need for boundaries. The 
                    limitations section acknowledges that their definition of interaction may not encompass all perspectives and 
                    outlines the constraints in their methodology. Lastly the conclusions reflect on how effective their methodologies 
                    in analysing interaction and propose a definition that bridges the gap between visualization and human computer 
                    interaction (HCI). As stated by the authors "We hope that our inclusive view of interaction will unify the 
                    visualization community under a common goal: the creation of visualization systems that empower those who use 
                    them."(Dimara and Penn, 2020)  </p>
